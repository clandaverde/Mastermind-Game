# Mastermind-Game

This game is called "Mastermind" its a text-based game and the objective is to guess the pegs (color and order) that the computer generates. You have 8 attempts to guess the correct color and ordering. There are 6 colors that can be picked; blue (B), green (G), pink (K), purple (P), red (R) and yellow (Y). Keep in mind that colors CAN be repeated. The abbreviations  that the computer will generate are sets of 4 pegs (for example: BKRG). Lastly, there are two additonal pegs (black and white) that will be displayed after each guess. The black peg indicates that the user has a code peg that is the CORRECT COLOR and in the CORRECT POSITION. A white peg indicates that the user has a code peg that is the CORRECT COLOR but in the INCORRECT POSITION. Goodluck!
